# Automatic Streetlights and Speedometer using Arduino Board LDR and Ultrasonic Sensor

This project is based upon streetlights and how they will turn ON and OFF in case of vehicle aprroach and brightness conditions using the ultrasonic sensor and LDR sensor respectively. Also, creation of an indication system to alert over-speeding drivers by calculating the speed of an approaching vehicle using the ultrasonic sensor.
